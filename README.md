### Hi there ðŸ‘‹, my name is Sujon Chambugong
#### I am Front-End Developer
![I am Front-End Developer](https://media-exp1.licdn.com/dms/image/C4D16AQHe98evRLZNhA/profile-displaybackgroundimage-shrink_200_800/0/1654695519024?e=1668643200&v=beta&t=fSkDoHgi8-Qao8vl3iBrbf3RRuIZQRPhgcl2SGlPi5A)

With a degree in Social Work and a strong knowledge of Front-End Development coupled with my determination to learn, I believe I am the ideal candidate for the Front-End Developer role.
I have worked as a Front-End Developer at Spirtus for the past year. Where I had knowledge in HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap. Besides, I have learned WordPress theme customization and basic theme development. 
For developing my web skill, I completed a web development course. Where I have learned ReactJs, JavaScript, NodeJs, and MongoDB. Some projects are done with them. Besides, I had to learn firebase, GitHub, Heroku, vercel, and netlify. I am also familiar with React-Redux and Unit Testing.
I am looking forward to meeting you in person to discuss how well I can be a fit in your organization. Thank you for your time and patience.
